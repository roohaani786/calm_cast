  static const timeBlockingDescription = "*How it works*: \n\nTime blocking involves scheduling your day into distinct blocks of time, each dedicated to a specific task or activity. You allocate specific time slots for work, meetings, personal tasks, and breaks.\n\n- *Benefits*: \n\nThis framework helps you focus on one task at a time, minimizes multitasking, and ensures that you allocate sufficient time to your most important activities. It also provides a visual representation of your day's commitments.- \n\n*Tips*: \n\nBe realistic about the time needed for each task, and include buffer periods for unexpected interruptions or transitions between activities.";
  static const eisenhowerMatrixDescription = "*How it works*: \n\nThe Eisenhower Matrix, also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix, categorizes tasks into four quadrants based on their urgency and importance. Tasks are sorted into: \n\n- Quadrant 1: \nUrgent and Important (Do immediately)\n\n- Quadrant 2: \nNot Urgent but Important (Schedule and prioritize)\n\n- Quadrant 3: \nUrgent but Not Important (Delegate if possible)\n\n- Quadrant 4: \nNeither Urgent nor Important (Eliminate or minimize)\n\n *Benefits*: \n\nThis framework helps you prioritize tasks effectively, ensuring that you focus on what matters most and avoid getting bogged down by less important activities.\n\n *Tips*: \n\nRegularly review and update your task list within this framework to adapt to changing priorities.";
  static const pomodoroTechniqueDescription = "*How it works*: \n\nThe Pomodoro Technique breaks your workday into short, focused intervals (usually 25 minutes) called Pomodoros, followed by a short break. After completing four Pomodoros, you take a longer break. During each Pomodoro, you work on a single task without distractions.\n\n *Benefits*: \n\nThis technique enhances productivity by promoting intense focus and preventing burnout. It's particularly effective for tasks that require concentration.\n\n *Tips*: \n\nUse a timer or Pomodoro app to track your work intervals, and commit to staying on task during each Pomodoro. Adjust the duration of Pomodoros and breaks to suit your preferences.";
  static const twoMinuteRuleDescription = "*How it works*: \n\nThe Two-Minute Rule is a simple strategy where if you encounter a task that can be completed in two minutes or less, you tackle it immediately rather than postponing it. \n\n*Benefits*: \n\nThis approach prevents small tasks from accumulating and becoming overwhelming. For individuals with ADHD, it minimizes procrastination and helps maintain a sense of accomplishment.\n\n*Tips*: \n\nKeep a list of tasks that can be handled in two minutes or less. Whenever you have a brief window of time, tackle one of these tasks. It's an excellent way to make the most of short bursts of focus.";
  static const abcDMethodDescription = "*How it works*: \n\nThe ABCD method is a task prioritization technique. You label tasks as A (high priority), B (medium priority), C (low priority), or D (delegate). \n\n*Benefits*: \n\nThis method helps individuals categorize tasks by importance, making it easier to focus on high-priority items first. For those with ADHD, it prevents feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of tasks and allows for efficient task management.\n\n*Tips*: \n\nRegularly review your tasks and adjust their priority levels as needed. Don't overcomplicate the system; keep it simple and intuitive to use daily. This method is most effective when combined with other planning techniques to create a well-rounded system for task management.";
